<h1>Color Theory</h1>

<p>Color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions, becoming a powerful tool in design. Learning to understand color can improve marketing to the correct audience. Through the use of color theory, we can better communicate and express the moods and feelings we want to show in our designs. Also, think back on our typography principles; they are the same!</p>

<h3>What is color?</h3>
<p>It all started with Sir Isaac Newton in 1666. He discovered colors were made up of a single wavelength and couldn't be seperated any further. How? By passing pure white light through a prism which seperated all the colors.</p>

<p>Through further experimentation, he discovered that the light could be combined with other colors to create new ones. For example, red light mixed with yellow light created an orange color. He was the first to understand the rainbow. At the time, it was thought that color was a mixture of light and darkness and that prisms <em>colored</em> light <a class="underline" href="http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/bh.html">(color vision &amp; art).</a></p>

<h3>Primary Colors</h3>
<p>There are three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. These main colors create all other colors on the spectrum. However, primary colors cannot be created by other colors.</p>

<h3>Secondary Colors</h3>
<p>There are three secondary colors: orange, purple, and green. These secondary colors are created by mixing the primary colors.</p>

<h3>Tertiary Colors</h3>
<p>There are many combination colors that come from mixing primary and secondary colors. These include yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green and yellow-green.</p>
