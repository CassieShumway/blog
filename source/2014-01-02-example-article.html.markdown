<p>This is just part of what Adam emailed to me before I had to take a moment before reading on. The chance to learn from 8th light was an opportunity I was more than happy to take. The thought of being challenged to learn and grow is something that I've always looked forward to. Most people don't enjoy the struggles and the all-nighters, but I love that "Aha!" moment even if you just spent 8 hours to figure a simple error.
