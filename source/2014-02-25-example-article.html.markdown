<h1>Good Practice in CSS</h1>
<h2>Reading Handcrafted CSS by Dan Cederholm</h2>

<p>Dan Cederholm talks about how good craftsmanship for the web is all about accounting for and anticipating any adjustments needed so that your design doesn't break. For me, its definitely been a struggle knowing the best approach to writing code in order to avoid this. 
</p>

<p>One of the first things that Cederholm dives into is the float property. If a floated element doesn't have a specified width, it'll expand as wide as it can.
Adding overflow:hidden to the element that contains the floated items is one method of self clearing. These small bits of advice are just the tip of the iceberg.
