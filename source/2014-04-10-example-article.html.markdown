<p>Best Practices With Type
</p>



<h3>Mixing Typefaces</h3>
<p>When mixing typefaces, you want to keep things simple.  </p>

<h4>1. Pick Twins</h4>
<p>Looking through all the fonts availalbe online can be daunting. So an easy and safe approach can be looking for typeface families that offer both serif and sans-serif characters (called "twins"). By doing this, you maintain compatibility and effortlessly mix two typefaces.</p>

<h4>2. Sans + Sans Serif</h4>
<p>An easy option to mixing two typefaces: use a sans serif + serif combination. Try keeping a classic heading with a neutral body typeface.</p> 

<div class="box">
  <p class=""
</div>

<p>If you decide to use a typeface with a lot of personality then be sure to keep other typefaces neutral to avoid any clashing.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="feather-image">Don't pair two slab serifs together</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Slab serifs will dominate any area they're used in</li>
</ul> 

<p>An example of clashing typefaces:</p>

<div class="box">
  <p class="font-fugaz">FUGAZ TYPEFACE</p>
  <p class="font-cinzel">CINZEL TYPEFACE</p>
</div>

<h4>3. Stay Within The Family</h4>
<p>If mixing typefaces scare you, simply choose a typeface that has several different styles and weights. By doing this, you can still build structure and beauty all while staying within the same typeface.</p>  

<div class="box">
  <p class="font-roboto-bold">ROBOTO TYPEFACE</p>
  <p class="font-roboto-light">This light weight 300 Roboto typeface works well with its heavier 700 weight as a headline. By using different weights, you can vary your typeface to give visual hierarchy.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider-short"> 

<h4>4. Think About The Details</h4>
<p>Try sticking to two typefaces that have similar x-heights, shape, and proportions. Be sure to consider the mood and personality of each font to create the right feel you want.</p>

<hr class="divider-short">

<h3>Heirarchy</h3>
<p>Be sure to always use heirarchy so you can cearly identify each element. For example, clearing defining a title and headline. By using varying sizes and font weights, you can better direct readers. 


Assign a role to each font/typeface and stick to it.

<h3>Personalities</h3>
<p>A list of described personalities from Douglas Bonneville in his article, "Best Practices of Combining Typefaces."</p>


<ul>
  <li>Rockwell - attention getting headlines</li>
  <li>New Baskerville - versatile transitional serif typeface. Has wide glyphs that would work well with a heavy set typeface (to off-balance) </li>
  <li>Clarendon Bold - slab serif. Distinct personality </li>
  <li>Franklin Gothic Bold - stoic, sturdy, strong but refined sense of elegance. Functional. </li>
  <li>Souvenir - playful, casual, pretty </li>
  <li>Futura Bold - has high x-heights, wide glyphs and very circular letter shapes.  </li>
  <li>Dax - modern, savvy and bright</li>
  <li>Bernhard Modern - classy, quiet, sophisticated</li>
  <li>Caslong - old style typeface but has been modernized. Nice neutral choice</li>
</ul>
